Ideas for functionailty:
  - add a hooksystem
    The bot is definitely not scaleable but some people asked me to also have the bot on their server
    so a hooksystem would allow the serverowner/a special role to enable and disable certain functions
    and it could be used on other servers. 

    Mapping from string to functionobject funcdict = {'function1': function1, 'function2': function2}
    Save all enabled functions in a config and reload that config on certain occasions

  - merge the bots together
    Have all the functions in one folder for better structure and less space. One script for each bot
    which then imports the functions
